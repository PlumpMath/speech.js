# Speech.js

###Making censorship circumvention as easy as signing into Facebook
Speech.js is a thin wrapper which translates between the traditional domain name system and the [.bit decentralized domain name system](http://dot-bit.org/Main_Page), transforming `example.bit`-> `example.jshost.tld`. Speech.js immunizes online speech from legal and political attacks by performing all routing using _client-side_ JavaScript and sourcing rouing information from the _users social network_.

Check out the [Speech.js Github page](http://speechjs.github.io/speech.js/) for more information.
