#Introduction
Speech.js is a JavaScript interoperability mechanism for Namecoin domains. It powers [Speech.is](https://www.speech.is).

This repo is in a state of flux as I am refactoring the meta-aspects of the project such as the server setup & babel.js.

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/speech/speech.js/wiki) for an architectural overview.
